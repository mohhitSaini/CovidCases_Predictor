# CovidCases_Predictor
The model predicts the covid cases based on the previous data for the rise of covis cases

Objective: The project aims to forecast future COVID-19 cases using autoregressive modeling (AR) on time series data, leveraging Python libraries including NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, scikit-learn, and SciPy. It involves data collection, EDA, AR model building, and statistical analysis to provide valuable insights for pandemic monitoring.

Expected Outcomes: By the project's conclusion, you'll have a predictive autoregressive model capable of estimating future COVID-19 cases, supported by statistical analysis. This AR model helps in understanding the pandemic's trajectory by capturing the temporal dependencies in the data and guiding data-driven decisions for managing and responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.
